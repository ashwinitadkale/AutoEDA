  - Reads CSV file and generates dataset summary
  - Handles missing values reporting
  - Outputs numerical & categorical summaries
  - Saves histograms, bar plots, and correlation heatmap
- `requirements.txt`: Initial dependencies (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)
- `.gitignore`: Ignore venv, caches, and outputs folder
